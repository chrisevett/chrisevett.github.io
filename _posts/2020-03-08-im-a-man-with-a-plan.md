Decided to start writing again and work on my online presence. I figure I've hit a point in my career where I should focus on my footprint as it pertains to the community and not just work on personal development.  

Here's some of my plans for the near future:

## work on building some easy to follow example reference projects  

Problems of infrastructure and software delviery have some pretty mature solutions as of late, but it seems like when it comes to open source tooling there isn't a "right way" to do things yet.  I want to take a stab at this and see what people think. The hardest part to me of getting value out of infrastructure as code principles and tooling was having to make it up as I went along most of the time.  


## write impactful guides on how to implement production ready container workflows  

Most guides I've seen in this space are sufficient to get a POC workflow together if you're interested in implementing something like kubernetes. The problem is that whenever you want to take it to the next step and make sure its secure, hardened, resilient, highly available etc there are scant few resources. After working on cloud infrastructure and continuous delivery pipelines for the past few years I think I have a good idea of what my ideal system would look like and how I would maintain that. I think it's imporant to share that knowledge.  

## use twitch streaming as an inspiration to get more done  

For the memes. I think its a good motivation tool.
